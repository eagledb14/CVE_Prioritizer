CVE-2009-2299,Priority 3,0.00484,5.0,CVSS 2.0,FALSE,The Artofdefence Hyperguard Web Application Firewall (WAF) module before 2.5.5-11635, 3.0 before 3.0.3-11636, and 3.1 before 3.1.1-11637, a module for the Apache HTTP Server, allows remote attackers to cause a denial of service (memory consumption) via an HTTP request with a large Content-Length value but no POST data.
CVE-2012-4360,Priority 3,0.002,4.3,CVSS 2.0,FALSE,Cross-site scripting (XSS) vulnerability in the mod_pagespeed module 0.10.19.1 through 0.10.22.4 for the Apache HTTP Server allows remote attackers to inject arbitrary web script or HTML via unspecified vectors.
CVE-2012-4001,Priority 3,0.0011,5.0,CVSS 2.0,FALSE,The mod_pagespeed module before 0.10.22.6 for the Apache HTTP Server does not properly verify its host name, which allows remote attackers to trigger HTTP requests to arbitrary hosts via unspecified vectors, as demonstrated by requests to intranet servers.
CVE-2024-27316,Priority 2,0.00124,7.5,CVSS 1.0,FALSE,HTTP/2 incoming headers exceeding the limit are temporarily buffered in nghttp2 in order to generate an informative HTTP 413 response. If a client does not stop sending headers, this leads to memory exhaustion.
CVE-2009-0796,Priority 3,0.0097,2.6,CVSS 2.0,FALSE,Cross-site scripting (XSS) vulnerability in Status.pm in Apache::Status and Apache2::Status in mod_perl1 and mod_perl2 for the Apache HTTP Server, when /perl-status is accessible, allows remote attackers to inject arbitrary web script or HTML via the URI.
CVE-2013-0942,Priority 3,0.00109,4.3,CVSS 2.0,FALSE,Cross-site scripting (XSS) vulnerability in EMC RSA Authentication Agent 7.1 before 7.1.1 for Web for Internet Information Services, and 7.1 before 7.1.1 for Web for Apache, allows remote attackers to inject arbitrary web script or HTML via unspecified vectors.
CVE-2013-0941,Priority 3,0.00042,2.1,CVSS 2.0,FALSE,EMC RSA Authentication API before 8.1 SP1, RSA Web Agent before 5.3.5 for Apache Web Server, RSA Web Agent before 5.3.5 for IIS, RSA PAM Agent before 7.0, and RSA Agent before 6.1.4 for Microsoft Windows use an improper encryption algorithm and a weak key for maintaining the stored data of the node secret for the SecurID Authentication API, which allows local users to obtain sensitive information via cryptographic attacks on this data.
CVE-2011-2688,Priority 2,0.00202,7.5,CVSS 2.0,FALSE,SQL injection vulnerability in mysql/mysql-auth.pl in the mod_authnz_external module 3.2.5 and earlier for the Apache HTTP Server allows remote attackers to execute arbitrary SQL commands via the user field.
CVE-2013-2765,Priority 3,0.01832,5.0,CVSS 2.0,FALSE,The ModSecurity module before 2.7.4 for the Apache HTTP Server allows remote attackers to cause a denial of service (NULL pointer dereference, process crash, and disk consumption) via a POST request with a large body and a crafted Content-Type header.
CVE-2011-1176,Priority 3,0.00338,4.3,CVSS 2.0,FALSE,The configuration merger in itk.c in the Steinar H. Gunderson mpm-itk Multi-Processing Module 2.2.11-01 and 2.2.11-02 for the Apache HTTP Server does not properly handle certain configuration sections that specify NiceValue but not AssignUserID, which might allow remote attackers to gain privileges by leveraging the root uid and root gid of an mpm-itk process.
CVE-2012-3526,Priority 3,0.03761,5.0,CVSS 2.0,FALSE,The reverse proxy add forward module (mod_rpaf) 0.5 and 0.6 for the Apache HTTP Server allows remote attackers to cause a denial of service (server or application crash) via multiple X-Forwarded-For headers in a request.
CVE-2013-4365,Priority 2,0.00639,7.5,CVSS 2.0,FALSE,Heap-based buffer overflow in the fcgid_header_bucket_read function in fcgid_bucket.c in the mod_fcgid module before 2.3.9 for the Apache HTTP Server allows remote attackers to have an unspecified impact via unknown vectors.
CVE-2007-4723,Priority 2,0.0057,7.5,CVSS 2.0,FALSE,Directory traversal vulnerability in Ragnarok Online Control Panel 4.3.4a, when the Apache HTTP Server is used, allows remote attackers to bypass authentication via directory traversal sequences in a URI that ends with the name of a publicly available page, as demonstrated by a "/...../" sequence and an account_manage.php/login.php final component for reaching the protected account_manage.php page.
